    This is a sample swagger file to explore some of the Synology Web APIs.
    [Generate your own swagger file](https://github.com/mikespub/synology)


    If you want to try this out on your own Synology, this requires adding
    a rest.php file in the base directory of your Web Station to act as a
    gateway to the actual Synology Web APIs.


    Except for SYNO.API.Info query, most API calls assume that you have
    logged in first via SYNO.API.Auth, and received a session id (sid).
    You will need to update the default value of the _sid parameter below
    in your swagger file so that all API calls can use the right value.


    There are many versions of the swagger file available, one using short
    urls with query parameters, and the other specifying the complete path
    including the 4 standard parameters for each API method. Any special
    additional parameters needed for a particular API method are not taken
    into account here (except for login).
