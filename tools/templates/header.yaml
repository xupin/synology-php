    This is a sample swagger file to explore some of the Synology Web APIs.
    [Generate your own swagger file](https://github.com/mikespub/synology)


    If you want to try this out on your own Synology, this requires modifying
    the .htaccess file in /usr/syno/synoman/webapi:

    ```
    # CHECKME: add CORS support for Swagger Editor
    SetEnvIf Origin ":" IS_CORS
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin "%http%://%host%" env=IS_CORS
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Headers "*" env=IS_CORS
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Methods "GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, OPTIONS" env=IS_CORS
    # CHECKME: add correct JSON content type for Swagger Editor
    SetEnvIf Accept "application/json" IS_JSON
    Header set Content-Type application/json env=IS_JSON
    ```


    Except for SYNO.API.Info query, most API calls assume that you have
    logged in first via SYNO.API.Auth, and received a session id (sid).
    You will need to update the default value of the _sid parameter below
    in your swagger file so that all API calls can use the right value.


    There are two versions of the swagger file available, one using short
    urls with query parameters, and the other specifying the complete path
    including the 4 standard parameters for each API method. Any special
    additional parameters needed for a particular API method are not taken
    into account here (except for login).
